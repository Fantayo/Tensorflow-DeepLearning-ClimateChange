    "Gradio is a powerful, open-source library for building user interfaces (UI) in Python. It allows developers to easily create web-based interfaces for machine learning models, data visualization, and other Python scripts. With Gradio, you can easily share your work with a wider audience and make your models accessible to non-technical users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the key features of Gradio:\n",
    "- **Easy to use**: Gradio has a simple and intuitive API that makes it easy to get started.\n",
    "- **Built-in support for popular ML libraries**: Gradio has built-in support for popular ML libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch, allowing you to easily deploy your models.\n",
    "- **Customizable**: Gradio provides options for adding custom HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to the interface, allowing you to customize the look and feel of your application.\n",
    "- **Advanced features**: Gradio provides advanced features such as authentication and access control, logging, monitoring, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can easily install Gradio using `pip` and start building your interface with as little as few lines of code. The library is well-documented and there are plenty of resources and tutorials available to help you get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, you can check out the [official documentation](https://gradio.app/docs) and the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gradio-app/gradio)\n"

    "- **Interfaces**: In Gradio, an interface is a web-based UI that allows users to interact with a machine learning model or other Python script. An interface can be built using the `gr.Interface` class and can consist of inputs, outputs, and custom HTML, JavaScript and CSS.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Run function**: The run function is a python function that takes the inputs as inputs and returns the outputs. It is the backbone of the interface, it is the function that will be executed when the user interacts with the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inputs**: An input is a parameter that the user can interact with to generate the output. For example, an image classifier would have an input of an image. In Gradio, inputs can be created using the `gr.inputs` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Outputs**: An output is the result generated by the model or script based on the inputs. In Gradio, outputs can be created using the `gr.outputs` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Customization**: Gradio provides options for customizing the look and feel of the interface using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Additionally, it also provides options for customizing the functionality and behavior of the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Launching**: Once the interface is created, it can be launched by calling the `launch()` function on the interface object. This will open the interface in a new browser tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sharing**:  Once the interface is launched, it can be shared with others via a shareable link. This allows others to use the interface without having to run the code locally."

    "Gradio has built-in support for several types of inputs and outputs, which can be used to create a wide range of interfaces, some of the most common ones are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inputs\n",
    "- **Textbox**: Accepts a single line of text input from the user. Can be customized with options such as `label`, `placeholder`, `default`.\n",
    "- **Checkbox**: Accepts a boolean input from the user. Can be customized with options such as `label`, `default`.\n",
    "- **Radio**: Accepts one option from a set of options provided by the user. Can be customized with options such as `label`, `options`, `default`.\n",
    "- **Select**: Accepts one option from a set of options provided by the user. Can be customized with options such as `label`, `options`, `default`.\n",
    "- **Slider**: Accepts a numeric input from the user within a range provided by the user. Can be customized with options such as `label`, `min`, `max`, `step`, `default`.\n",
    "- **File**: Accepts a file input from the user. Can be customized with options such as `label`, `allowed_extensions`.\n",
    "- **Image**: Accepts an image input from the user. Can be customized with options such as `shape`, `label`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Outputs\n",
    "- **Textbox**: Displays a single line of text. Can be customized with options such as `label`.\n",
    "- **Label**: Displays probability scores for a set of classes. Can be customized with options such as `label`, `num_top_classes`.\n",
    "- **Plot**: Displays a plot. Can be customized with options such as `label`.\n",
    "- **Chatbot**: Displays a chatbot interface. Can be customized with options such as `label`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these components can be easily used by importing them from the `gradio.inputs` and `gradio.outputs` modules. For more information, you can check out the [official documentation](https://gradio.app/docs/#components)"
