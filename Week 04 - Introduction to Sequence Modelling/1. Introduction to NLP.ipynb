        "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It deals with the analysis, understanding and generation of human language in a meaningful and useful manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the applications of NLP is sentiment analysis, which is the task of determining whether a given piece of text has a positive, negative or neutral sentiment. Another application is machine translation, which is the task of translating one language into another.\n",
        "\n",
        "TensorFlow and Keras are popular open-source tools used in NLP, which are both highly customizable and flexible. These tools allow you to build and train deep learning models for NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification and text generation.\n",
