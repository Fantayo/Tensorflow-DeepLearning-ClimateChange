        "We'll start by discussing the different types of time series and the challenges associated with time series forecasting. Then, we'll cover the basics of TensorFlow and how to use it for time series forecasting. Finally, we'll build a simple time series forecasting model using TensorFlow and evaluate its performance.\n",
